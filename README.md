# ðŸ“– Purchase Card Transactions

In this [dataset](https://www.cityobservatory.birmingham.gov.uk/@birmingham-city-council/purchase-card-transactions/) you have a collection of purchase card transactions for the Birmingham City Council. This is a historical dataset, youâ€™re able to perform any of the following tasks:

- 1.  (Clustering) Discovering profiles (whether the case) or unusual transactions (anomalies detection) ...
- 2.  (Forecasting) Try to guess future transactional behaviors. For instance, what would be the next purchase? Expenditures forecasting? ...
- 3.  (Creativity) State a problem.

Itâ€™s up to you defining the time window in which your analysis will take place
